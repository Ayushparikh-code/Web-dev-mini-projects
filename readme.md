## Features

- **Conversational AI**: Engage with users through natural language processing, providing answers to queries and managing conversations.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Extract text from images, enabling the chatbot to interact with visual data.
- **Multi-Functional Interface**: Seamlessly switch between chatting and OCR processing.
- **Customizable Responses**: Modify and enhance response patterns based on user needs.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- An active account with Gemini API

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-chatbot-gemini.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ai-chatbot-gemini
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your API key:

   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content:

   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

To run the chatbot, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

Once running, you will be prompted to input either text for conversation or upload an image for OCR processing. The chatbot will automatically detect your input type and respond accordingly.

### Chat Mode

Type your message, and the bot will generate a response using the Gemini API.

### OCR Mode

Upload an image, and the bot will process the image to extract text using OCR capabilities, then display the extracted text.

## Configuration

You can customize various elements of the chatbot, such as:

- **Response Patterns**: Modify response templates in the `responses.json` file.
- **OCR Settings**: Adjust OCR processing parameters in the `ocr_config.py` file.
