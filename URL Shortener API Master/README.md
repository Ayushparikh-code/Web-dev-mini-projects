## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I tried some new things in this project and one of them was placing media queries after each section instead of adding them at them end in
a bulk.
Also learned about basics of Application Programming Interface, on how to make GET/POST requests
using the shortcode API to shorten long links.

### Continued development

I am looking forward to make this revisiting the project and integrating an authentication functionality using Firebase and Mongo DB for
storing shortened links.
