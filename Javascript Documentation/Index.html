          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
          and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
          structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
          variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
          example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
            to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
            client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
            HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
            and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
            relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
            extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
            provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
            the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
          </li>

        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
  
        <ul>
          <li>
            A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).

      <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
          in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
          Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
          Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
          constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
          JavaScript.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
          declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
          number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
          JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
          class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
          inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
          JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
          requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
          loosely typed methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
          have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
          be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
          you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
          function return types are not explicitly typed.

    <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
      <header>Hello world</header>
      <article>
        To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
        first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
        <code
          >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");
        </code>
  
        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
        browser!

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>
        You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
        names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
        dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
        JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
        "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
        You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
        identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
        _name.
      </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
      <header>Declaring variables</header>
      <article>
        You can declare a variable in three ways:
        <p>
          With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
          can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
          always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
          warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
          can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
          below.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
      <header>Variable scope</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
          global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
          current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
          called a local variable, because it is available only within that
          function.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
          rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
          global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
          code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
          context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
          is an if statement.
        </p>
        <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
        <p>
          This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
          ECMAScript 2015.
        </p>
  
        <code
          >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
          defined</code
        >

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
      <header>Global variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
          pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
          variables using the window.variable syntax.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or
          frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame
          name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
          document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
          parent.phoneNumber.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
      <header>Constants</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
          syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
          identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
          can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
        </p>
  
        <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
        <p>
          A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
          while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
          variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
          represent a variable.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
          variable in the same scope. For example:
        </p>
  
        <code
          >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
          CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
          }</code
        >
        However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
        is executed without problems.
        <code
          >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code
        >

    <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
      <header>Data types</header>
      <article>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
              <li>
                null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
                is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
                other variant.
              </li>
              <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
              <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
              <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
              <li>
                Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
                unique and immutable.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
  
          <li>and Object</li>
        </ul>
        Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
        to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
        are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
        objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
        your application can perform.

    <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
      <header>if...else statement</header>
      <article>
        Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
        true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
        is false. An if statement looks as follows:
  
        <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
        condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
        Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
        condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
        statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
        including further nested if statements.
        <p>
          You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
          conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
        </p>
        <code
          >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
          } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
        </code>
        In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
        evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
        them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
        to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
  
        <code
          >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
          statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
          statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
          statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
        >
        It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
        because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
        the code. For example, do not use the following code:
        <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an
        assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
        additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
  
        <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
      <header>while statement</header>
      <article>
        A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
        evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
  
        <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
        statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
        statement following the loop.
  
        <p>
          The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
          the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
          tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
          control is passed to the statement following while.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
          those statements.
        </p>
  
        Example:
  
        <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
  
        <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
        <p>
          With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
          Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
        </p>
  
        <ul>
          <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
          <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
          <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
          true, so the loop terminates.

    <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
      <header>Function declarations</header>
      <article>
        A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
        statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
  
        <ul>
          <li>The name of the function.</li>
          <li>
            A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
            separated by commas.
          </li>
          <li>
            The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
            brackets, { }.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
        </p>
  
        <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
        <p>
          The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
          consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
          function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
          specifies the value returned by the function.
        </p>
        <code>return number * number;</code>
        <p>
          Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
          value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes
          the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
          the calling function.
